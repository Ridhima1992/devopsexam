                    I found a love for me<br>
                    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
                    Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
                    Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
                    <br>
                    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
                    Not knowing what it was<br>
                    I will not give you up this time<br>
                    But darling, just kiss me slow<br>
                    Your heart is all I own<br>
                    And in your eyes you're holding mine<br>
                    <br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
                    With you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass<br>
                    Listening to our favourite song<br>
                    When you said you looked a mess<br>
                    I whispered underneath my breath<br>
                    But you heard it,<br>
                    Darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
                    <br>
                    Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
                    She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
                    I found a love to carry more than just my secrets<br>
                    To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
                    <br>
                    We are still kids but we're so in love<br>
                    Fighting against all odds<br>
                    I know we'll be alright this time<br>
                    Darling, just hold my hand<br>
                    Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
                    I see my future in your eyes<br>
                    <br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
                    With you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass<br>
                    Listening to our favourite song<br>
                    When I saw you in that dress<br>
                    Looking so beautiful<br>
                    I don't deserve this<br>
                    Darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
                    <br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark<br>
                    With you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass<br>
                    Listening to our favourite song<br>
                    I have faith in what I see<br>
                    Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
                    And she looks perfect<br>
                    I don't deserve this<br>
                    You look perfect tonight
                </div>
